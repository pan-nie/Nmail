# Nmail

**An AI butler for your chaotic inbox — living on your own computer.**

Every account gathered into one inbox; AI sorts, archives, pre-drafts replies, and reports daily.<br>
You read, you edit, you decide — and **not a byte of your data ever leaves your machine**.

**AI does the chores; every send and every action still goes through you.**

## ✨ What it does for you

- 🤖 **An AI butler that actually works** — say "archive last week's marketing mail, then reply to Zhang for Thursday"; it searches, organizes, drafts and sends end to end. Unsure? It asks first. Writes go through approval cards, everything is logged and undoable.
- ✍️ **Drafts first — the send button is yours** — mail that needs a reply gets pre-drafted into a review queue; you tweak two words, give a nod, and only then it goes. AI wraps up automatically after you approve or reject.
- 📊 **A clear account, every day** — a daily digest at a fixed time: how many arrived, what matters, who is waiting for you. The butler sweeps the box on schedule, summarizes and pre-drafts replies; read the full text right from the notification.
- 📥 **All mailboxes, one inbox** — Gmail / Outlook / QQ / 163 and 20+ presets: type an address and you're in. Cross-account smart views, explorer-style folder management, and archiving that really moves mail on the server.
- 🔒 **Local-first, private by design** — the service binds to `127.0.0.1` only; mail, contacts and keys never touch a cloud, there is no account system and no telemetry. AI uses your own OpenAI-compatible key — point it at Ollama / LM Studio for 100% local inference.
- 🔌 **Open, automatable** — a local REST API plus the `nmail-cli` CLI: hook up iOS Shortcuts, Raycast, n8n; or install the whole mail skill into agents like Claude Code with one `npx skills add`.

## 🚀 Up and running in a minute

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (once — reopen your terminal afterwards):

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Then launch:

```bash
uvx --from nmail-app nmail
```

Your browser opens `http://127.0.0.1:8720`. This command **is the launcher** — run it every time (the package is cached; launches are near-instant from the second run). Want double-click launch? Run `uvx --from nmail-app nmail install-shortcut` to create a desktop icon (each launch auto-uses the latest version; closing the tabs shuts the background down). Upgrade with `uvx --refresh --from nmail-app nmail`.

**First-time setup (~5 minutes)**

1. **Add a mailbox**: Settings → Add account; the address alone matches your provider's servers. Gmail / Outlook authorize with one click via built-in public OAuth credentials; password-based accounts use an app-specific password.
2. **Configure AI**: Settings → AI configuration; add any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Base URL + API key + model — DeepSeek, OpenRouter, local Ollama all work) and click "Test connection".

> Prefer a plain executable? Standalone binaries (Windows / macOS / Linux), winget, Homebrew, pip and running from source are all documented in **[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)**.

## 🔒 Privacy, by design

- The mail store, index and secrets live in a local data directory ([location & backup](docs/INSTALL.md#数据位置备份与卸载)); upgrades and reinstalls never touch it.
- Exactly two explicit outbound calls: the AI endpoint you configure (mail body snippets; zero outbound when pointed at local Ollama) and an anonymous 24-hour update check (version number only, can be disabled).
- The server binds to `127.0.0.1` only, with no option to listen externally; HTML mail renders in a sanitized sandbox iframe and remote images are blocked by default to defeat tracking pixels.
- Full text: **[docs/隐私与安全.md](docs/%E9%9A%90%E7%A7%81%E4%B8%8E%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8.md)** (Chinese).
